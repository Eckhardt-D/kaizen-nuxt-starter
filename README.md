# Kaizen Nuxt Starter

Just a simple base Nuxt3 app that comes with the stuff I like to use. Not actively
maintained for the public, but free to use if you wish.

- Need to install the DB driver manually from drizzle
- Update db folder configs to suite your driver
- Update migration scripts in package.json


```sh
bunx nuxi init -t gh:Eckhardt-D/kaizen-nuxt-starter
```
